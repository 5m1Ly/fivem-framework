<strong>!! development of this framework is dicontinued !!</strong>

The framework is far from done, if you would want to use this you need to do a couple of things to set it up.

## Installation
1. Download and place the latest server artifact within the the artifact folder
1. go into the config folder and copy all the files and paste the within
1. replace '.example' for '.cfg' also make sure the file name doesn't contain '(1)', '1' or ' copy'
1. set the correct information within all the config files
	- principal (sever_admin.cfg)
	- mysql connection string (sever_db.cfg)
	- server key (sever_keys.cfg)
	- steam web api key (sever_keys.cfg | not required)
	- server info (sever_info.cfg | project name, tag, etc)

1. When you have done all the steps above correctly you can start the server
